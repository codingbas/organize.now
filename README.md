## UX 
This web application is a simple ToDo app made in Django. You can have a trial version where you can make 10 ToDo's. When you buy the premium version you have unlimited ToDo's. It is designed to allow users to make any todo what they normally write down on paper. You will have the user whom wants to use the trial version and make sure the 10 ToDo's are finished on time. 
The premium user will have all their ToDo's online to have a great overview what to do per day, week or month.
